This lottery deal has a pool of prizes and a list of people joining the pool of prizes. People send some amount of money to the contract. As soon as people send some amount of money, they are recorded as a player. After a certain period of time, the contract manager will make a contract to pick a winner. Then the contract will randomly pick the winner and transfer all the money from the prize pool to the winner. At that point, the lottery contract is reset and ready to accept a new list of players.
